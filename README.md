# Heaps Project

This project was written for a class that simulated cracking pin numbers using a minimum value heap and a maximum value heap. The pin numbers were sorted by the number of times the pin number occurs in a given data set. This was done so that the simulation could try both the most common pin numbers and the least common pin numbers first, to show the difference in efficiency.
