# Heaps Project

This project written for a class that simulated crakcing pin numbers using of a minimum value heap and a maximum value heap of pin numbers, sorted by the number of times the pin number occurs in a given data set. This was done so that the most common pin numbers and least common pin numbers were tried first, to show the difference in efficiency.
